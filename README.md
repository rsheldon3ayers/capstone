# [Co:Read](https://co-read-quiz.firebaseapp.com/)

I needed an app that helped me get the most out of the books I read. The app generates a quiz based on the notes you take. In order to continue taking notes you must successfully complete the quiz. I built it using Angular, Bootstrap and Firebase.
